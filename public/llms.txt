## Quick Summary

Building software that feels like thinking. Systems where mental models become structure,
behavior becomes enforced, and complexity dissolves into clarity—without forcing you into
abstraction hell.

## Core Philosophy

Most developers force users to understand their architecture. I preserve yours and extend
it with depth.

I build type systems that encode behavior, not just data. The compiler enforces your domain
logic—crash hard, burn loud, start fast. No runtime surprises.

Your mental model becomes the structure. Real constraints—HIPAA rules, energy costs, user
cognitive load—become architectural guarantees. Illegal states become unrepresentable.

## Technical Capabilities

**Primary Domains:**
- Full-Stack Architecture
- AI Systems Engineering
- Cross-Domain Integration
- Type-First Design
- Event Sourcing & Temporal Logic
- Multi-Agent Orchestration
- Cognitive-First UX Design

**Tech Stack:**
- Systems: Rust, OCaml, Elixir, Go
- Application: TypeScript, Python
- Frontend: React, Effect-TS, Convex
- Backend: Phoenix, Event-Driven Architecture
- AI/ML: PyTorch, Multi-Agent Systems
- Platforms: WASM, Cloud Infrastructure

## Mental Models & Approach

1. **Constraints Define Structure**: Domain constraints, physics, regulations become the type
   system. HIPAA rules compile. Energy budgets enforce.

2. **Events Over State**: State is derived, never stored. Append-only logs as truth with
   deterministic derivation. Time travel and audit trails come free.

3. **Circular Continuity**: Objects evolve bidirectionally. Note → Task → Workflow, and back.
   Transform + Ghost mechanics preserve provenance.

4. **Cognitive-First Design**: Max 3 choices per screen. Neurodivergent-friendly. Zero
   cognitive overhead between thought and action.

5. **Approve, Don't Build**: Systems observe patterns, suggest automations. Users approve
   with one tap. No canvas dragging, no workflow builders.

6. **Progressive Reveal**: Zero-config by default. Four layers: Invisible → Ambient →
   Detailed → Expert. Configuration is a failure mode.

7. **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Specialized AI systems with consensus mechanisms. Each
   agent handles what it does best, coordinating through structured protocols.

8. **Decimal-Precision Math**: AI agents need deterministic computation. Business math with
   Decimal.js precision. No floating-point surprises.

9. **Cross-Domain Integration**: Traditional boundaries between domains are arbitrary. Business
   logic compiles. ML respects physics. Infrastructure becomes interface.
