# Eassa Ayoub

> Cognitive-First Systems Architect based in Philadelphia, PA. Building software that matches how humans actually think — specializing in AI infrastructure, type-driven design, and production hardening.

## About

Eassa Ayoub is a systems architect who specializes in taking AI-generated prototypes from "works in demo" to production-ready. His approach centers on cognitive-first design: reducing complexity for users by making it the machine's problem through type systems, event sourcing, and architecture that compiles correctness rather than documenting it.

## Expertise

**Production Hardening & AI Code Remediation**
- Takes AI-generated prototypes and makes them production-grade
- Fixes compliance gaps, race conditions, and architectural debt
- Rebuilds systems so illegal states are unrepresentable at the type level

**Cognitive-First Systems Architecture**
- Software that matches how humans actually think
- Interfaces that preserve mental models instead of retraining brains
- Neurodivergent-friendly by design, not accommodation

**Compliance by Architecture**
- HIPAA, SOC2, regulatory rules enforced by the compiler
- Architecture where violations are impossible, not just prohibited

## Technical Stack

- **Systems languages:** Rust, OCaml, Go, WASM
- **Runtime platforms:** TypeScript, Elixir, Python, Effect-TS
- **Frontend:** React, Three.js, Astro, Phoenix
- **AI/ML:** PyTorch, Multi-Agent Orchestration

## Selected Work

- Healthcare tools rebuilt with local-only processing for HIPAA compliance by architecture
- Production memory framework for AI agents with retrieval, decay scoring, context reconstruction
- Event-sourced CRM rebuild with full audit trail and zero data loss
- Type system encoding loan regulations where illegal loans are compile errors
- Memory-hierarchy-aware ML pipeline routing with 6400x cost transparency improvement
